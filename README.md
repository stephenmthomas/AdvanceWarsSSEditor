# AdvanceWarsSSEditor
Advanced Wars mGBA SS Editor

A VS2019/Visual Basic save state editor for Advance Wars, using the mGBA save state format. Coded in Visual Basic 2019. Source code is simply zipped here. Basic code, and not error proofed, but does show how to load and save binary data from/to files using particular hex addresses/offsets.

Just two files here - a zip code containing the executable, and a screen shot.

The zip file has the VS2019 source code and project files included.
